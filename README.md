# Urdu-Text-Sentiment-Analysis-Natural-language-processing
**Development of an Automatic Sentiment Analysis Tool for Urdu Text on
Social Media Platforms**

Scenario:
You are a data scientist working at a leading technology firm that specializes in sentiment
analysis for social media content. The company is expanding its market to cater to Urdu-
speaking users on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Given the surge in
Urdu content, the company wants to develop a sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for
the Urdu language.

Your task is to develop an NLP pipeline to analyze Urdu social media posts, classifying them
into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The tool will serve multiple purposes, such as
helping brands understand customer feedback, influencers gauging audience engagement, and
businesses assessing public sentiment toward their products and services.

Key Challenges:
1. Urdu Text Complexity
o Grammar: Urdu follows a different grammatical structure than English,
including subject-object-verb (SOV) word order, making it challenging to apply
traditional NLP models trained on English data.
o Morphology: Words in Urdu can change depending on gender, plurality, and
tense. For instance, ";اچھا"; (good) changes to &quot;اچھی&quot; (good, feminine) and &quot;اچھے&quot;
(good, plural). Handling these morphological variations is crucial for effective
text processing.

o Script and Writing Style: Urdu is written from right to left, and its script
includes characters that may be difficult to tokenize and process in typical NLP
pipelines.

3. Noisy Data from Social Media


o Emojis and Special Characters: Social media posts are often filled with emojis
and special characters that need to be handled appropriately. Emojis can add
sentiment, and handling them can help improve sentiment prediction.

o URLs and Hashtags: Posts may contain hashtags, URLs, and other non-
informative tokens that should be removed or handled to avoid distorting the
sentiment analysis results.

o Spelling Variations: Users may type words phonetically, which can lead to non-
standard spellings that are harder to process (e.g., &quot;شکریہ&quot; (thank you) may be
written as &quot;شکریا&quot;). Handling such variations is crucial.

3. Short Conversations &amp; Incomplete Sentences
   
o Social media posts often consist of short phrases, sometimes with missing
subjects or objects, making it harder to extract meaningful sentiment.
Understanding the context within short text snippets is a challenge that the NLP
system must handle.

5. Limited Language Resources

o Unlike English, there are limited Urdu stopword lists, pre-built models, and other
pre-trained NLP resources (e.g., Word2Vec or BERT models for Urdu).
Developing custom solutions for these tasks requires deep domain expertise.

7. Urdu Social Media Dataset
   
o You will be working with a publicly available dataset of Urdu text from social
media platforms such as Twitter or YouTube comments. This dataset contains raw
social media posts and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative,
neutral). Your goal is to preprocess and classify sentiment based on this dataset.

Assignment Breakdown:
Phase 1: Text Preprocessing for Urdu Text
1. Stopword Removal:
o Develop a custom list of Urdu stopwords (e.g., &quot;اور&quot;, &quot;یہ&quot;, &quot;کہ&quot;). Write a function
to remove these stopwords from your dataset of social media posts.
o Challenges to Address: Handle words that are often considered stopwords but
may carry sentiment (e.g., &quot;نہیں&quot; (no), &quot;برا&quot; (bad)).

2. Punctuation, Emojis, and Hashtags:
o Remove unnecessary punctuation, emojis, URLs, and hashtags that don’t
contribute to sentiment.
o Bonus Task: Use a dictionary to translate common emojis into sentiment (e.g., ��
= positive, �� = negative).

3. Short Conversations:
o Write a rule-based function to filter out very short posts or those with less than
three words, as they may not carry sufficient sentiment.



Phase 2: Stemming and Lemmatization for Urdu Text
1. Stemming:
o Implement or utilize a stemming algorithm for Urdu. The algorithm should reduce
word variants to their base form (e.g., &quot;اچھا&quot;, &quot;اچھی&quot;, &quot;اچھے&quot; → &quot;اچھا&quot;).
o Challenges to Address: Handling word inflections due to gender and plurality in
Urdu.

3. Lemmatization:
o Implement lemmatization for Urdu, which requires using dictionaries or rules to
return words to their dictionary form.
o Expected Output: For example, &quot;چل رہی&quot; (is moving) should be reduced to &quot;چل&quot;
(move).

Phase 3: Feature Extraction from Urdu Text
1. Tokenization:
o Implement word tokenization for Urdu text, ensuring that the Urdu script is
properly segmented into words. You can use existing tokenizers or build your
own.
o Deliverable: Provide a tokenized version of several Urdu social media posts.
2. Tf-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
o Apply the Tf-IDF algorithm to extract relevant terms from the dataset. Identify
the most important terms contributing to sentiment in Urdu text.
o Expected Output: A table showing the top 10 words with the highest TF-IDF
scores from the dataset.

3. Word2Vec:
o Train a Word2Vec model on your dataset to capture the relationship between Urdu
words based on context.
o Deliverable: List the top 5 words most similar to the word &quot;اچھا&quot; (good) using the
trained model.

Phase 4: N-grams Analysis
1. Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram Analysis:
o Create unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams from the dataset of Urdu text.
o Deliverable: List the top 10 most common bigrams and trigrams in the dataset,
along with their frequencies.
o Challenges to Address: Proper tokenization for Urdu to avoid breaking the
words incorrectly (due to right-to-left script).


Phase 5: Sentiment Classification Model
1. Model Building:
o Using the features extracted (from Tf-IDF or Word2Vec), build a machine
learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes) to classify the
sentiment of the Urdu posts.
o Deliverable: Show the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of your sentiment
classifier using a test set of Urdu text.

Phase 6: Evaluation &amp; Optimization
1. Evaluation:
o Evaluate the model&#39;s performance on a validation set of Urdu posts. Analyze
where the model performs well and where it struggles (e.g., understanding
complex sentences or detecting sarcasm).
o Deliverable: Present evaluation metrics and discuss areas where improvements
can be made.

2. Challenges in Urdu Sentiment Analysis:
o Discuss the challenges faced when performing sentiment analysis in Urdu,
including handling complex morphology, colloquial language, and noisy data
from social media.

Final Deliverables:
1. Code Notebook: A Jupyter notebook or Python script with detailed comments for each
phase.
2. Text Preprocessing Results: Display the cleaned Urdu text after applying various
preprocessing techniques.
3. Feature Extraction Results: Present tokenized text, TF-IDF scores, and Word2Vec
outputs.
4. N-gram Analysis: Show the top unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
5. Sentiment Classification Model: Provide a summary of the machine learning model,
along with evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
6. Reflection: A 1-2 page reflection discussing the challenges faced and how your NLP
pipeline for Urdu sentiment analysis can be further optimized.

Tools and Libraries:
 Python programming language
 NLTK, spaCy, or Polyglot for text processing



 Scikit-learn for machine learning models
 Gensim for Word2Vec
 pandas, matplotlib for data analysis and visualization
Dataset:
 Use a publicly available Urdu social media dataset, such as the one provided by Urdu
Twitter Sentiment Dataset on Kaggle or other similar datasets.

Expected Outcome: By the end of this assignment, you will have developed a comprehensive
NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis in Urdu, providing valuable insights into how Urdu text can
be processed, transformed, and classified.
